Phusion Passenger Standalone requires some binaries, such as the Nginx core. It
can download these binaries from the Phusion server (faster) or it can build
these from source (slower, requires additional dependencies). But to download
binaries, a download tool is required.

 * <b>Option 1 (recommended):</b> If you want the binaries to be downloaded, please
   press <b>Ctrl-C</b>, install a download tool as instructed below, and re-run
   Phusion Passenger Standalone.

<% @runner.missing_dependencies.each do |dep| -%>
    - <%= dep.install_instructions %>
<% end -%>

 * <b>Option 2:</b> If you want the binaries to be compiled from source, press <b>Enter</b>.

Awaiting your choice...
