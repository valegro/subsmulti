/**
 * Represents an application process, as spawned by a Spawner. Every Process has
 * a PID, an admin socket and a list of sockets on which it listens for
 * connections. A Process is usually contained inside a Group.
 *
 * The admin socket, an anonymous Unix domain socket, is mapped to the process's
 * STDIN and STDOUT and has two functions.
 *
 *  1. It acts as the main communication channel with the process. Commands are
 *     sent to and responses are received from it.
 *  2. It's used for garbage collection: closing the STDIN part causes the process
 *     to gracefully terminate itself.
 *
 * Except for the otherwise documented parts, this class is not thread-safe,
 * so only use within the Pool lock.
 *
 * ## Normal usage
 *
 *  1. Create a session with newSession().
 *  2. Initiate the session by calling initiate() on it.
 *  3. Perform I/O through session->fd().
 *  4. When done, close the session by calling close() on it.
 *  5. Call process.sessionClosed().
 *
 * ## Life time
 *
 * A Process object lives until the containing Group calls `detach(process)`,
 * which indicates that it wants this Process to shut down. This causes
 * `signalDetached()` to be called, which may or may not send a message
 * to the process. After this, the Process object is stored in the
 * `detachedProcesses` collection in the Group and are no longer eligible for
 * receiving requests. Once all requests on this Process have finished,
 * `triggerShutdown()` will be called, which will send a message to the
 * process telling it to shut down. Once the process is gone, `cleanup()` is
 * called, and the Process object is removed from the collection.
 *
 * This means that a Group outlives all its Processes, a Process outlives all
 * its Sessions, and a Process also outlives the OS process.
